      Papyrus Gamification Plugin
While modeling is now validated as effective for solving complex
problems or developing complex systems, its widespread and systematic
application has not yet lived up to expectations. According to
several studies, the complexity of the modeling languages and
tools and the lack of required skills in abstraction are part
of the reasons of this situation. For us, gamification could
play an important role in order to lower the entry barrier of
modeling and modeling tools. Gamification is the exploitation
of gaming mechanisms for serious purposes, like promoting behavioral
changes, soliciting participation, and engagement in activities.
Papy Game is a gamified software modeling environment realized
to design games for specific training/learning goals.
Includes games Hangman, On your Own, and Flow.
